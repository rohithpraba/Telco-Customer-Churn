## 📊 Methodology

* **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types.
* **EDA**: Visualize distributions, correlations, and churn trends.
* **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical variables, scale features.
* **Modeling**:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost
* **Evaluation**:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  * Confusion Matrix
  * ROC Curve

## ✅ Results

* The best-performing model is highlighted in the notebook.
* Key churn indicators are identified, such as:

  * Long service downtimes
  * High international call rates
  * Poor customer support ratings

---

## 📈 Business Insights

* Retention strategies are proposed based on churn drivers.
* Churn can be reduced by focusing on customer satisfaction, proactive outreach, and competitive pricing.

---

## 🧠 Future Work

* Incorporate deep learning models.
* Deploy the model via a web app.
* Automate periodic churn predictions.
